# Basic Platformer

## INTENTION
Learn how does a game really work by designing one after watching a [step-by-step youtube video](https://youtu.be/S8lMTwSRoRg?si=U3HUz6R6lnx_VFcG). 
Although, i don't think that watching merely a yt video and making a game out of it especially when all the work was done by the yt guy and all i have to do is follow through **makes me a game developer** but i got the basic idea. And will definately try out new games in future, and modify this too.
